I'm a software engineer who is passionate about making open-source more accessible, creating technology to elevate people, and building community, online & offline. Some technologies I enjoy working with include Ethical Hacking, Java, Python (Tensorflow, APIs + Markup) and Android Developement. My interest in the Android Developement and open -source led me to contribute in more than 5 projects (Based on Android Open Source Project).<img align="right" src="https://github.com/dinesh-ysl/dinesh-ysl/blob/master/9fc2126eec2c0a3876e3f2097af9b983.gif" alt="Illustration of ready" width=350px height=260px/>
